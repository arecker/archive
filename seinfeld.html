    <p>Do you recognize this song?</p>
    <p>
      It’s the original theme song of the TV show Seinfeld . Before the show hit
      its comfortable stride in the early summer of 1991, there was a five
      episode pilot season in the summer of 1989. The theme in the above video
      was replaced by the infinitely more famous synth and bass riff composed by
      Jonathan Wolff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up owning the entire catalog on DVD. No matter what I was doing,
      there was always a Seinfeld episode playing in the background to soak up
      the silence. I preferred episodes from the meatier range of the sitcom.
      Somewhere in the show’s time line where all the characters had hit their
      stride, but still had not jumped the shark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilot episode is entitled The Seinfeld Chronicles - a departure from
      the usual “The SOMETHING” all other episodes followed. In the pilot, Jerry
      has anxiety about a visiting female friend who is giving off mixed
      signals. George and Kramer do their best in advising Jerry, but ultimately
      all his efforts are futile when she casually informs him that she is
      engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the plot has familiar elements, the characters in the pilot are
      barely recognizable. George is witty and dignified, Kramer is a timid
      shut-in, and Elaine is absent from the episode all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfamiliarity of this episode along with the other four in the first
      season are what drove me away from them. But I had a thought the other day
      - perhaps the first season of Seinfeld is intended to be more of a
      prologue than an opening act. Perhaps it’s supposed to feel very different
      from the show.
    </p>
    <p>
      This thought struck me - each person of the Seinfeld cast seems normal in
      the first season. The first season is a prologue in which we witness
      Jerry, George, Kramer, and Elaine reach a breaking point that leads them
      to a hilariously superficial and cynical take on life.
    </p>
    <h2 id="george">George</h2>
    <p>
      George Costanza is the American loser. He has no dignity, sense of
      purpose, or self-worth. He is the man that hires a contractor to modify
      his work desk to better accommodate secret naps in his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The George Costanza we hold dear wouldn’t come close to recognize the man
      portrayed in The Seinfeld Chronicles . Let’s remain on the surface for a
      bit and just examine his transformation in appearance.
    </p>
    <p>This is the George you probably think of.</p>

        <img alt="georgeAfter" src="/images/georgeAfter.jpg" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>This is George in his first appearance of the show.</p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/georgeBefore.jpg">
        <img alt="georgeBefore" src="/images/georgeBefore.jpg" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Though George exhibits some eccentricity, he is presentable and
      well-groomed. His hair is proudly combed, even after work hours in a
      crummy laundromat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog follows this trend. Later in the show, we rely on George for
      outbursts. He grunts, sweats, blushes, and screams. In the pilot, we find
      a suave, witty companion fit to converse with a comedian and meet him on
      his level. Much different from the George who is dim and an admitted
      failure with understanding women, this George readily offers Jerry advice
      on understanding their nuances. Here is a snippet of their conversation.
    </p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
        <pre
          class="highlight"
        ><code>GEORGE: So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!

JERRY: Yeah, well…not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.

GEORGE: [whistles disapproving] Ho ho ho, "Had to"? "Had to come in"?

JERRY: Yeah, but…

GEORGE: "Had to come in" and "maybe we'll get together"? "Had to" and "Maybe"?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: No…no…no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna see this woman.

JERRY: [indignant] What, are you serious…why, why did she call?

GEORGE: How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.

JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!

GEORGE: All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?

JERRY: Yes!

GEORGE: You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!
</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      This George is confident in his mastery of women - a far fling from the
      George who desperately resorted to doing the opposite of his instincts to
      get women.
    </p>

    <p>
      First season George was a hard worker. In the first episode, Kramer
      aimlessly asks George about his profession. George engages him seriously
      about the real estate market.
    </p>
    <p>
      George is also remarkably successful. In The Stock Tip , George stands
      behind his investment in a business idea - even when Jerry pulls out. He
      reaps the profit as the idea takes off. The episode ends with George
      victoriously puffing on a cigar in the cafe and treating everyone to
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what broke this vibrant, hard-working, insightful George Costanza?
      Things begin to fall apart in the second season as George finds himself
      fighting against his sexist boss for his dignity. In The Revenge , George
      enlists the help of Elaine to humiliate him by ‘slipping him a mickey’ at
      an office party. Just as the boss publicly redeems George with accolades,
      he sips the poison and keels over. George is fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      George shares a dark moment with Jerry where he pitifully muses on what
      little options he has left to pursue. I believe this is George’s breaking
      point. He realizes that no matter how much he cares about things, he
      ultimately has no control over what happens. Getting hired, fired, and
      promoted honestly has nothing to do with work ethic. Meeting smart,
      attractive women has nothing to do with his insight. And as he swallows
      that bitter pill while sitting on Jerry’s apartment floor, he evolves into
      the bitter, neurotic friend that is George Costanza.
    </p>
    <h2 id="kramer">Kramer</h2>
    <p>
      Kramer is the wild card - the bizarre neighbor that we can rely on to
      barge into Jerry’s apartment with a fresh scheme plucked from the
      disturbed machinations of his metropolis fried brain. He is perhaps known
      best for the way he barges into Jerry’s apartment.
    </p>
    <p>Want to see my favorite Kramer entrance?</p>
    <iframe
      width="560"
      height="315"
      class="embed-responsive-item"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2qdKds2a78"
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      Yes - you watched that right. Kramer doesn’t burst into the room ready to
      spout off a new scheme. Kramer knocks, then timidly asks “Are you up?”,
      then slips in quietly. He still raids Jerry’s fridge for leftovers, but he
      is much more mysterious about it. This is a very different Kramer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he and Jerry shoot the breeze, Jerry mentions in passing that Kramer
      hasn’t left the apartment in years. Kramer is a shut-in. Later in the
      episode when he and George are in the same room, it is clear that they
      barely know each other. He even wonders with George if he should get into
      the real estate game - and not in the typical far-fetched Kramer way. He
      actually seriously considers it - as if he is short on money.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the episode The Statue, Jerry, George, and Elaine struggle to confront
      a graduate student about a cherished statue that he swiped from Jerry’s
      apartment while cleaning it. Jerry is uncomfortable doing anything without
      the police, Elaine fears upsetting her relationship with the man’s lover
      as a business client, and George is useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Kramer sits alone staring into the fourth wall, occasionally
      breaking the dialog to mutter to himself, I’m not happy about this. We
      should just get him . This is Kramer’s breaking point. I like to imagine
      he is wrapping his head around the astounding truth that he is the only
      one there with nothing to lose. He doesn’t know anyone. He has no money.
      He has no connections or valued relationships. He is free to do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kramer slips out of the apartment and proceeds to do the most Kramer thing
      of all. He impersonates an FBI agent and fast talks the man into giving up
      the statue.
    </p>

      allowfullscreen=""
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      This is Kramer’s transformation. Perhaps the realization that he has
      nothing to lose in life gives him the courage to develop into the
      extroverted, entrepreneurial, free-spirited maniac that we still love
      today.
    </p>
    <h2 id="elaine">Elaine</h2>
    <p>
      Elaine is charming, intelligent, and quick to see through anyone’s
      bullshit. Her brutal honesty makes her a turn-key fitting companion of
      Jerry, George, and Cosmo. Though she has many companions over the show’s
      time line, she remains totally self-sufficient. She bounces back quickly
      from breakups, as she is usually the one breaking things off.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was one relationship she evidently had a difficult time
      getting over. In The Stake Out Elaine dated Jerry. They wrestle with the
      awkward reality of remaining friends after their romantic involvement.
      Jerry feels so awkward about the whole thing that he refuses to ask Elaine
      about one of her friends he found attractive, opting instead to stake out
      her building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry and Elaine’s tip toeing around their feelings for one another are
      the closest thing to a real human moment in Seinfeld. But slowly her human
      side begins to form calluses. In The Ex Girlfriend , Elaine wrestles with
      her neighbor’s sudden aversion to greetings in the hallway. In The Pony
      Remark , Elaine loses her apartment to Jerry’s obnoxious cousin Jeffery
      due to an old man’s hearing impairment. Despite her talent and likability,
      Elaine is constantly met with other people’s incompetence and
      indifference. Elaine’s transforms into a cynical, capable woman who goes
      into every human interaction expecting to be disappointed - whether she is
      dating a moronic car mechanic or trying to avoid indulging everyone’s
      fascination with <em>The English Patient</em>.

    <h2 id="jerry">Jerry</h2>
    <p>
      Jerry undergoes absolutely no character development. He is static and
      unchanging. This was no mistake. I believe Jerry was intentionally left in
      tact to be the mocking observer of the Seinfeld world. He contributes
      nothing, demands nothing, and despite his exposure as a comedian he leaves
      little impression on the women he dates. He is ysimply a human version of
      bugs bunny wandering around in a world composed of his own stand up
      material.
    </p>
    <p>
      He even flaunts his own plot immunity in the show. In The Opposite, Jerry
      remarks that everything always works out for him. Despite how dynamically
      the people around him succeed and fail, Jerry always breaks even without
      trying.
    </p>

      allowfullscreen=""
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      To borrow from Kramer’s unintentionally profound line in
      <em>The Opera</em>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        You’re the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You’re the Miana!
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      But while his importance to the balance of the group is vital, Jerry is
      valueless as a person. Next time you are watching, take note of how many
      times a character will attempt to share their issues with Jerry, then give
      up in frustration under his low calorie mockery.
    </p>
    <h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
    <p>So why is Seinfeld so fun to watch? Is it simply the comedy?</p>
    <p>
      Or does it meet us in a darker place. Do we secretly acknowledge that we
      indeed have no control over the world. That we may really have nothing to
      lose. That no matter how capable we are in our own life, some schmuck will
      tumble along to disappoint us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps a show about nothing comforts us in the face of a life that feels
      like it is about nothing. Maybe there is a little George, Elaine, and
      Kramer budding inside of each person stuck in traffic or working a
      thankless job and a Jerry that can’t help but sit back and heckle.
