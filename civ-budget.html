      <strong>Edit</strong>: Hi everybody. I had no idea our little experiment
      would get so much attention. I’ve rebooted the project in hopes of turning
      it into a public tool. Keep an eye out for the first release of
      <a href="https://github.com/arecker/bennedetto">bennedetto</a> - coming
      soon!
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Any couple that says they never fight has probably never had to talk about
      money. I know this because Marissa and I used to be that couple. When you
      are dating, money isn’t an issue. It’s a special occasion every time you
      see each other, so nobody feels guilty springing for movie tickets,
      dinner, or betting on one of Wheaton’s famous underground cock fights.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now we argue about money. Arguments aren’t a bad thing. I welcome an
      argument as long as something good comes out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money is going to add friction to any relationship, especially if you
      don’t have a good system in place. I succumbed to the temptation of
      allowing my checking balance to govern my mood. Every two weeks, I would
      be on top of the world, then a dull panic would creep over me as the days
      passed - seasoned with the occasional blowup about an expense that I
      didn’t plan for that always seemed like it would be the end of me. Then I
      would get paid again. It was a roller coaster, and I had no insights into
      how much money we were really saving and spending.
    </p>
    <h2 id="shopping-for-a-system">Shopping for a system</h2>
    <p>
      Marissa and I knew that we needed a budget. At the very least, I just
      needed to feel like I was trying. That way if our financial lives were
      decimated I could at least point to something and say See? At least we had
      a budget!
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent a few months shopping around for a system we liked. Mint.com,
      Dave Ramsey, free consultations - nothing quite felt right. My complaints
      with whatever we were trying were usually one of these three:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Constant estimations</strong> - Most systems required us to sit
        down and plan out what we were going to spend each month. There were too
        many things that we simply couldn’t estimate or didn’t care to estimate.
        Plus, I got tired of “babysitting” my estimations - needing to
        constantly refine them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Big feedback loop</strong> - Most systems are monthly. This
        sucked, because we would have to go thirty days without any meaningful
        information - and what information we had was almost always based on
        wild estimations anyway.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Burden of proof</strong> - Most systems tied to our bank
        account, and the numbers would look strange if we didn’t account for
        everything that we were spending. Adding purchases was cumbersome. I
        don’t like needing to associate everything to a category. If I buy a
        stick of gum, does it go under “Food”, “Miscellaneous”, or should I make
        a “Miscellaneous Food” category?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Please don’t send me an email defending your favorite system. I know a
      handful of people who were rescued from crippling debt by Dave Ramsey, or
      who follow mint.com like it’s a religion. Whatever you use fits your
      needs, but it didn’t fit ours.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-inspiration">The inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      My wife and I play Sid Meier’s Civilization together - especially on
      nights where we need to take our thoughts off of money. It’s one of those
      turn-based games where you run a group of people, settle somewhere on the
      globe, and slowly build cities and armies until you take over everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each turn, the game tracks your income and expenses in food, gold, and
      happiness. They are shown in an indicator bar like this.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/civbar.png">
        <img alt="civbar" src="/images/civbar.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The numbers beside the gold coin represent how much gold you have in
      total, as well as how much you are making or losing every turn. Mousing
      over the gold coin shows a more granular breakdown of where all your
      spoils are going.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/civgold.png">
        <img alt="civgold" src="/images/civgold.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Certain buildings or factions cost gold to maintain, just as certain
      buildings make gold. Each source of gain and loss is part of how much gold
      you are making or losing per turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night while we playing I sleepily remarked how I wish we could see a
      breakdown like that for our money. I elaborated on how cool it would be if
      we could pay our bills this way. I was tired of trying to assess how we
      were doing financially while our account balance was jumping around so
      dramatically month to month. I wished instead that money could come in and
      go out more consistently - like water draining from a faucet.
    </p>
    <p>
      That got me thinking - what is stopping us from finding out how much money
      we are making <em>daily</em>? If our life were a Civ game, how much “gold”
      would we be making every “turn”?
    </p>
    <h2 id="finding-the-magic-number">Finding the magic number</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to find out how much money we were making every day. This was not
      an estimate. I was tired of estimations. I wasn’t going to attempt to
      include things like gas, our electric bill, or groceries. I’m talking
      about straight automated cash - like how much I would be making if I could
      cryogenically freeze myself and somehow continue to get a paycheck and pay
      bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first thought was Netflix. It’s $8 a month, and it is setup to just
      take money out of my PayPal account. In a scenario like this, Netflix
      would continue to get their money. I made a table like this.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/spreadsheet1.png">
        <img alt="spreadsheet1" src="/images/spreadsheet1.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      By taking the amount due on each bill ($8), the number of days per bill
      (30 - roughly a month), I could get the amount of money Netflix costs per
      day by just dividing Column B by Column C - $0.26 per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now another automatic expense. I own the domain [alexrecker.com], which
      costs me $10 a year. My domain provider withdraws money from my account
      when they need it. I added it to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the same method, it is clear that [alexrecker.com] costs me $0.03 a
      day. A sum of column D will give me a net loss of all my bills per day -
      so far just Netflix and my domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did this for every expense I could. Again, because this was a calculated
      rate, only bills that were totally fixed and automated could be included.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I had all my bills in, I added my paycheck. Summing all my daily
      expenses with my daily income gave me the magic ‘gold per turn’ number I
      was looking for. I was happy it was positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best part about this number was that there was almost no estimation
      involved. I didn’t have to make any wild guesses about things I didn’t
      care about to get instant feedback. Knowing how much money I get to keep
      in a day was already giving me a valuable objective perspective.
    </p>
    <h2 id="bookkeeping">Bookkeeping</h2>
    <p>
      This number was great, but not everything in life can be automated. We had
      to come up with a way to get feedback from one time purchases and
      semi-regular expenses as well.
    </p>
    <p>I opened a new LibreOffice spreadsheet that looked like this.</p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/spreadsheet3.png">
        <img alt="spreadsheet3" src="/images/spreadsheet3.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This was where I kept track of my daily expenses. All I needed was the
      date, a description of what it was (to jog my memory if I was to go over
      it again), and the amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started the new sheet with the magic daily number I calculated before,
      which is a positive number. Any purchases I made that day would be entered
      in as negative amounts. Likewise, if I came upon cash it would be entered
      as a positive amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the day, it was safe to say that the sum of Column C
      represented <strong>how much money I made that day</strong>. If it were
      negative, that means I spent more money than I make in a day. If it were
      positive, that means I saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I had here was more <strong>instant</strong> feedback. Now I was
      keeping track of how much I was <em>saving</em> every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, I opened a new sheet and started it like the last, opening
      it with a positive transaction of the magic number. My cellphone bill was
      due that day, and since the total depends on how much data my wife and I
      use, that could not be part of our magic number. I paid the bill, which
      made us very negative for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some days were negative, I could still add up each day of the week
      to find out how much I saved over the past few days. If I had a bad week,
      I could theoretically add up each week to get a number for the month.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rigged up the spreadsheet to give me these numbers on a summary page.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/spreadsheet4.png">
        <img alt="spreadsheet4" src="/images/spreadsheet4.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This sheet told me the running total for that day, the week, the month,
      and the year. When I first started, all four numbers were identical, but
      as the weeks turned over, I started to more diverse results. While my
      daily total would fluctuate from exactly my magic number in the morning to
      well negative when we would go out to eat, the weekly and monthly average
      would even things out. As long as our weekly and monthly total was
      positive, we didn’t have to worry too much. If those started to dive, we
      would change our habits and keep our daily total positive until our other
      numbers began to improve.
    </p>
    <h2 id="asking-the-right-questions">Asking the right questions</h2>
    <p>Here’s what I love about this system:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Little estimation</strong> - There was no guessing required to
        get going with this. Everything I entered was factual. Rates were
        limited to automated purchases, and purchases were entered realtime with
        very little overhead.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Small feedback loop</strong> - This system was immediately
        useful. We could wake up the next day knowing how much we were going to
        make and exactly how much our day-to-day purchases would compare to
        that.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ready for experimentation</strong> - Because the numbers were so
        straight forward, we were free to look at the data and form simple tests
        around it. If I thought taking the bus every day would help us save
        money, I could try it for a week and examine the results. While
        categories and groups aren’t needed to add purchases, I could certainly
        tack them on to whatever purchases I wanted to track - say, comparing
        bus fees with money spent at the gas pump. Rather than needing to prove
        everything , I could focus on one behavior at a time and quickly see if
        these guesses were supported by one clear, obvious result.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="fun-with-data">Fun with data</h2>
    <p>
      Our new budget has evolved quite a bit beyond my LibreOffice spreadsheet.
      I’ve moved the operation to a Django web application. This allows me to
      automate calculating my magic number, opening new days, and entering in
      purchases. Being able to access our budget from a mobile friendly website
      also makes the data entry less painful.
    </p>
    <p>Our dashboard lists the purchases we made that day.</p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/moolah1.png">
        <img alt="moolah1" src="/images/moolah1.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      When we make a purchase, there is a form that flips out from the top. It
      was very important to me that this form include as
      <em>little</em> information as possible.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/moolah2.png">
        <img alt="moolah2" src="/images/moolah2.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Beside it, there is a widget to show us the running total for the day,
      week, month, and year.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/moolah3.png">
        <img alt="moolah3" src="/images/moolah3.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Here is the fun part. I made a few graphs to give us an idea of how we are
      doing. This is a graph that shows us what our total was each day, along
      with the corresponding day from last week. This is valuable when we are
      picking which days we are going to go out to eat.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/moolah4.png">
        <img alt="moolah4" src="/images/moolah4.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This is a break down of all the expenses and sources of income that make
      up our magic number that opens each day with a positive amount. The slices
      are automated expenses mixed with automated income, but I plan on color
      coding it to make it a little easier to see.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/moolah5.png">
        <img alt="moolah5" src="/images/moolah5.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This graph shows the progression of what the yearly savings number was on
      any given day. I’m still waiting for this one to even out, but once it
      does, it should give us a good idea of how much we are saving in the long
      run. Ideally, we would like it to slowly climb despite daily flux.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="/images/moolah6.png">
        <img alt="moolah6" src="/images/moolah6.png" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      So that’s our Civ inspired budget. I’m sure you have a system of your own,
      but I wanted to share ours just in case you are still shopping for a good
      fit.

    <p>
      As I mentioned, my new budget is powered by a Django app I put together
      that is getting better over time. You can view the source
      <a href="https://github.com/arecker/moolah">here</a>, but I wanted to take
      you through a few snippets of how I got Django and Angular to do all the
      work for me.

        There is no special reason I am overriding id with a

        just prefer this over the default int because I think it looks cooler in
        a database. Django’s documentation shows how to do this.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am supplying an additional validator to days to protect the model from
        tripping into a situation where it is dividing by zero. As long as this
        number is a positive integer, that won’t happen.

      I figured these

    <p>
      For this reason, a custom

      Next, I needed a way to sum these up. Django’s ORM supplies a handy
      aggregate function, as well as a QuerySet API to make any custom manager
      functions chain-able.
    </p>
    <p>
      I defined a custom
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuerySet</code> for
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rate</code> and
      associated it to the model using
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.as_manager()</code>.

      Because the app was restful, I knew I was going to end up sending ISO date
      strings from Moment.js down to the server. I wanted to still be able to
      send strings into these methods, so I decided to handle all the str to
      datetime conversion in one place with a decorator and the dateutil
      package.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decorator
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@sanitize_dates</code>
      simply attempts to parse each argument into a datetime before invoking the

      By invoking Django’s named URLs in inline JavaScript and saving them off

      constant.
